# Dealership_DOTNET

This project was developed for the Web Programming course at Babes-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca, year 2, semester 2.


Write a web application for managing a second-hand car business, using Dotnet. The application should maintain various information about a car in the database (i.e. model, engine power, fuel, price, color, age, history etc.). The application should implement: car browsing, adding, removing and updating a car. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. category), should be displayed.
